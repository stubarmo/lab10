<h1>What's XML/h1>
<ol>
   <li>What is xml? XML stands for extensible markup language it was developed by the W3C as a method to create information formats. It is similar to HTML and it is a text-based syntax to exchange, describe, and deliver. XML does not replace HTML, but rather extend power to it./li>
   <li>How is XML used? XML is used to support the exchange of information such as store and transfer throughout the system of databases, websites, and applications .</li>         
   <li> What does XML look like? XML tags is similar to HTML, the only difference is that it is not open to webpage visitors, but used as a stored data .</li>

<h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What Is JavaScript? Javascript was developed by Brendan Eich at NETSCAPE it is a client-side scripting language interpreted by a web browser. It is known to be object-based because it's influenced by the objects intercepted with a webpage document such as forms, images, and hyperlinks (referenced from Chapter 11.7) </li>
<li>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions? There are different elements, properties, method, and functions within Javascript. With Ajax you can create xtml and the http to retribute data. There is JQuery where you can manipulate Ajax or CSS hyperlinks, I think that Wikipedia could be a source of JQuery, because you can easily manipulate and have access to the data it is a considered a open library to change at any moment.</li>
<li>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? With Wikipedia(HTML and Open Library) which in my eyes is a prime example of JQuery which is under JavaScript it can be easily accessed to change CSS imaging and data for example if I was to go under a celebrity or historical fact I have that option to change it to whatever I want which is changing the data of what's stored already. I'm not too sure on the administrators and how it operated, but what I can say is that they might have all of the data stored, so at any point it can be regulated back to the way it was. I strongly believe that Wikipedia is a great example of how JavaScript (JQuery) can be related to HTML and CSS. </li>
</ol>
<p> In conclusion, I believe that XML and Javascript is a strong attribute to HTML especially throughout the database. It is a simple provider to storage and information throughout the computer system and very much relevant to how the data is stored.
